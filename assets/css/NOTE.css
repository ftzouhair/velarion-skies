/*
NOTE: CSS STRUCTURE AND LOAD ORDER

1. critical.css:
   - Contains only the essential, above-the-fold styles needed for the initial paint.
   - This includes the header, navigation, and hero section.
   - It should be inlined in the <head> of the HTML document for the fastest possible rendering.

2. style.css:
   - Contains all other styles for the site.
   - This file should be loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking the initial render.
   - Example: <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">

By separating the CSS in this way, we ensure that the user sees the main content of the page as quickly as possible, improving the perceived performance of the site.
